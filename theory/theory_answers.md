# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

## Q1: TensorFlow vs PyTorch
- TensorFlow uses static computation graphs; PyTorch uses dynamic (eager execution).
- TensorFlow is preferred for deployment; PyTorch for research and prototyping.

## Q2: Jupyter Notebooks Use Cases
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Interactive model development with visualizations

## Q3: spaCy vs Python string ops
- spaCy provides tokenization, NER, POS tagging, which are not available with basic string functions.

## Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn is best for classical ML; TensorFlow is designed for deep learning.
- Scikit-learn is simpler for beginners.
- Both have strong community support.
